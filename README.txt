Study based on an experimental design to assess the effect of vegetation cutting in seed predation and reproductive output.

The experiment was performed in two populations of the perennial plant Gentiana pneumonanthe where the butterfly seed predator Phengaris alcon was present. There were two treatments: one where all vegetation but Gentiana plants were cut (Cut), and one where nothing was done (Uncut or Control). The experiment was performed in population "Högsjön" in 2015 (5 plots/treatment, 10 plants per plot) and in population "Remmene" in 2016 (10 plots/treatment, <20 plants per plot).
